# Session Continuation - AtGames Ecosystem Investigation

## Current Session Status

**Date**: 2024-08-28  
**Session Focus**: Project restructuring and setup  
**Status**: ✅ **Completed** - Investigation project structure established

## What Was Accomplished

### Project Restructuring
- ✅ Created `atgames-ecosystem-investigation` as the main project directory
- ✅ Moved cursor rules from `retro_backend_java` to centralized `cursor-rules/` folder
- ✅ Created symbolic links to all four repositories in `repositories/` folder
- ✅ Established investigation-focused directory structure
- ✅ Created workspace configuration with proper folder organization
- ✅ Documented investigation framework and methodology

### Directory Structure Created
```
atgames-ecosystem-investigation/
├── documentation/          # Investigation findings and reports
├── cursor-rules/          # Centralized AI rules (moved from retro_backend_java)
├── history/              # Session logs and progress tracking
├── analysis/             # Comparative analysis and diagrams
└── repositories/         # Symbolic links to investigation subjects
    ├── retro_backend_java -> ../../retro_backend_java
    ├── arcadenet -> ../../arcadenet
    ├── CE-AtGames -> ../../CE-AtGames
    └── dongle_menu_qt -> ../../dongle_menu_qt
```

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Begin Individual Repository Analysis**
   - Start with systematic analysis of each repository
   - Document technology stacks, architectures, and key components
   - Create individual system profiles

2. **Establish Analysis Templates**
   - Create standardized templates for repository analysis
   - Develop consistent documentation formats
   - Set up comparison matrices

### Investigation Phase 1 Tasks
- [ ] Analyze `retro_backend_java` (Java Spring Boot backend)
- [ ] Analyze `arcadenet` (Ruby on Rails web app)  
- [ ] Analyze `CE-AtGames` (C++ engine/OS)
- [ ] Analyze `dongle_menu_qt` (Qt desktop app)

## Important Context for Next Session

### Project Focus
This is an **investigation project**, not a development project. The goal is to understand relationships between four AtGames repositories, not to build or modify them.

### Workspace Setup
- Main workspace: `/Users/gregstout/Documents/GitLab/atgames-ecosystem-investigation/`
- Use the `.code-workspace` file for proper folder organization
- All repositories accessible via symbolic links in `repositories/` folder

### Investigation Approach
- Systematic analysis of each repository individually first
- Then comparative analysis to identify patterns and relationships
- Focus on architecture, data flow, and integration points
- Document findings in `documentation/` and `analysis/` folders

---

**Ready to Resume**: The project structure is complete and ready for systematic investigation of the four repositories.
