# Project Restructure Summary

**Date**: 2024-08-28  
**Objective**: Restructure project from retro_backend_java-focused to investigation-focused

## What Was Changed

### Before Restructure
- Project was centered on `retro_backend_java` repository
- Cursor rules scattered across individual repositories
- No centralized investigation framework
- Mixed development and investigation concerns

### After Restructure
- Created dedicated `atgames-ecosystem-investigation` project
- Centralized cursor rules in investigation project
- Clear separation between investigation and subject repositories
- Organized structure for systematic analysis

## New Project Structure

```
atgames-ecosystem-investigation/
├── .cursor/                    # Active cursor project configuration
├── documentation/              # Investigation findings and reports
├── cursor-rules/              # Centralized AI rules (backup/reference)
├── history/                   # Session logs and progress tracking  
├── analysis/                  # Comparative analysis and diagrams
├── repositories/              # Symbolic links to investigation subjects
│   ├── retro_backend_java -> ../../retro_backend_java
│   ├── arcadenet -> ../../arcadenet
│   ├── CE-AtGames -> ../../CE-AtGames
│   └── dongle_menu_qt -> ../../dongle_menu_qt
├── README.md                  # Project overview and goals
└── atgames-ecosystem-investigation.code-workspace
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Clear Investigation Focus**: Project purpose is now explicitly investigation, not development
2. **Centralized Rules**: All cursor AI rules in one place for consistent analysis
3. **Organized Documentation**: Structured folders for findings, analysis, and history
4. **Easy Repository Access**: Symbolic links provide access without mixing concerns
5. **Proper Workspace**: VS Code workspace configured for investigation workflow

## Migration Actions Completed

- ✅ Created investigation project directory structure
- ✅ Moved cursor rules from `retro_backend_java/.cursor/` to investigation project
- ✅ Created symbolic links to all four repositories
- ✅ Established documentation framework and templates
- ✅ Created workspace configuration with organized folder structure
- ✅ Removed old cursor rules from individual repositories
- ✅ Verified all repository links are functional

## Next Steps

The project is now ready for systematic investigation:

1. **Begin Individual Repository Analysis**
   - Analyze each repository's architecture, technology stack, and purpose
   - Document key components and patterns
   - Create individual system profiles

2. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Compare technologies, patterns, and approaches
   - Identify integration points and dependencies
   - Map data flow between systems

3. **Ecosystem Understanding**
   - Create comprehensive architecture diagrams
   - Document system relationships and dependencies
   - Summarize findings and recommendations

## Workspace Usage

To work with this investigation project:

1. Open `/Users/gregstout/Documents/GitLab/atgames-ecosystem-investigation/` in Cursor
2. Use the `.code-workspace` file for proper folder organization
3. Access repositories via the `repositories/` folder symbolic links
4. Document findings in `documentation/` and `analysis/` folders
5. Track progress in `history/` folder

**Status**: ✅ **Restructure Complete** - Ready for systematic investigation
