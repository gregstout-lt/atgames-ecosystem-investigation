# AtGames Ecosystem Investigation Overview

## Investigation Framework

### Research Questions

1. **System Architecture**
   - How do these four systems relate to each other?
   - What is the data flow between systems?
   - Which systems are dependent on others?

2. **Technology Evolution** 
   - What is the chronological development order?
   - How have technologies and approaches evolved?
   - What patterns can we identify across the ecosystem?

3. **Integration Points**
   - Where do systems communicate with each other?
   - What APIs, protocols, or data formats are shared?
   - How is authentication/authorization handled across systems?

4. **Business Logic Distribution**
   - What business functions does each system handle?
   - Where is there overlap or duplication?
   - How is the overall user experience distributed?

## Investigation Methodology

### Phase 1: Individual System Analysis
- [ ] **retro_backend_java**: Modern Java backend analysis
- [ ] **arcadenet**: Ruby Rails legacy system analysis  
- [ ] **CE-AtGames**: C++ engine and OS documentation review
- [ ] **dongle_menu_qt**: Qt interface system analysis

### Phase 2: Comparative Analysis
- [ ] Technology stack comparison
- [ ] Architecture pattern analysis
- [ ] Data model comparison
- [ ] API design comparison

### Phase 3: Integration Mapping
- [ ] Identify communication protocols
- [ ] Map data flow between systems
- [ ] Document authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Trace user journey across systems

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Understanding
- [ ] Create comprehensive architecture diagram
- [ ] Document system dependencies
- [ ] Identify modernization opportunities
- [ ] Summarize findings and recommendations

## Key Artifacts to Produce

1. **System Profiles** - Detailed analysis of each repository
2. **Architecture Diagrams** - Visual representation of system relationships
3. **Data Flow Maps** - How information moves through the ecosystem
4. **Technology Comparison Matrix** - Side-by-side technology analysis
5. **Integration Points Documentation** - Detailed API and protocol analysis
6. **Evolution Timeline** - Historical development and decision points
7. **Findings Summary** - Key insights and recommendations

## Investigation Tools

- **Cursor AI**: Consistent analysis with shared rules
- **Codebase Search**: Deep code analysis and pattern recognition  
- **Documentation Review**: Existing docs, READMEs, and comments
- **Architecture Diagramming**: Mermaid diagrams for visualization
- **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side feature and technology comparison

## Success Criteria

The investigation will be considered successful when we can:

1. **Explain the Ecosystem**: Clearly describe how all four systems work together
2. **Map Dependencies**: Identify which systems depend on others and how
3. **Trace User Journeys**: Follow a user's interaction across multiple systems
4. **Identify Patterns**: Recognize common approaches and architectural decisions
5. **Recommend Improvements**: Suggest modernization or integration opportunities
