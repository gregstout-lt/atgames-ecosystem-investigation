# Individual System Analysis Plan
**Following Development Methodology: Phase 1 - System Mapping and Context Creation**

## Overview

This plan follows the development methodology for working with large existing systems. Each system will get its own comprehensive analysis following the **Technical Reference Map** approach with **functionality overview tables** organized by functional area.

## Analysis Structure for Each System

### **Phase 1.1: Technical Reference Map Creation**
For each system, create:
1. **Complete functionality mapping** - all functions, classes, controllers, services
2. **Dependency documentation** - how components interact within the system
3. **Functional area organization** - group related functionality together
4. **Integration point identification** - where the system connects to external services

### **Phase 1.2: System-Specific Documentation Structure**
Each system folder will contain:
- `01-functionality-map.md` - Complete function/class/controller mapping
- `02-business-logic-breakdown.md` - What the system actually does
- `03-data-models-and-storage.md` - Database/data structure analysis
- `04-internal-architecture.md` - How the system is organized internally
- `05-external-integrations.md` - What external services it connects to
- `06-configuration-and-deployment.md` - How the system is configured and deployed

## Individual System Analysis Plans

### **1. arcadenet-ruby-system** (Primary Production System)
**Focus**: Complete business logic mapping - this is the main system

**Key Analysis Areas**:
- **Controllers**: Map all 100+ controllers and their endpoints
- **Models**: Complete ActiveRecord model relationships
- **Services**: Business logic service layer analysis
- **Background Jobs**: Delayed job and worker analysis
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe, PayPal, Xsolla implementation details
- **Authentication**: Devise and custom auth implementation
- **API Versioning**: How v1, v2, v3, v4 APIs are structured

**Functionality Map Structure**:
| **Controller/Service** | **Business Purpose** | **Key Methods** | **Dependencies** | **External Integrations** |

### **2. retro-backend-java-system** (Incomplete Modernization)
**Focus**: What was actually implemented vs what's missing

**Key Analysis Areas**:
- **Spring Boot Architecture**: Controller/Service/Repository pattern usage
- **Implemented Domains**: Subscription, basic admin, statistics
- **Database Integration**: JPA/Hibernate implementation
- **API Structure**: REST endpoint organization
- **Missing Functionality**: Gap analysis against Ruby system

**Functionality Map Structure**:
| **Component** | **Implementation Status** | **Business Logic** | **Integration Points** | **Missing Features** |

### **3. QT-OS-system** (Hardware Interface Layer)
**Focus**: UI components and backend communication - skip interface docs, focus on systems

**Key Analysis Areas**:
- **Network Communication**: HTTP client implementation and API integration
- **Authentication System**: Login flow and token management
- **Local Data Management**: Settings, cache, offline storage
- **Business Logic**: What business rules are implemented in Qt vs backend
- **Hardware Integration**: Device UUID, hardware-specific functionality
- **Configuration System**: How settings and preferences are managed

**Functionality Map Structure**:
| **Component/Class** | **System Purpose** | **Backend Integration** | **Local Business Logic** | **Hardware Dependencies** |

### **4. CE-OS-system** (Core Engine)
**Focus**: System components beyond interface - engine, licensing, hardware control

**Key Analysis Areas**:
- **Game Engine Architecture**: Core engine components and game execution
- **License Management**: Local licensing system and DRM
- **Hardware Control**: Direct hardware interface and control
- **System Services**: Background services and system integration
- **Purchase/Subscription Logic**: How billing and purchases are handled
- **Configuration Management**: System-level configuration and settings

**Functionality Map Structure**:
| **Engine Component** | **System Function** | **Hardware Interface** | **Business Logic** | **External Dependencies** |

## Implementation Priority

### **Phase 1: Ruby System Analysis** (Highest Priority)
- This contains the most business logic and is the production system
- Understanding this system is critical for any future decisions
- Most complex system with the most functionality

### **Phase 2: QT-OS System Analysis** (Second Priority)  
- This is the primary hardware interface
- Contains important device integration logic
- Has significant local business logic for UI and device management

### **Phase 3: CE-OS System Analysis** (Third Priority)
- Focus on non-interface components (since interface docs already exist)
- Important for understanding hardware control and game execution
- Contains licensing and DRM business logic

### **Phase 4: Java System Analysis** (Final Priority)
- Understand what was actually implemented
- Document gaps and incomplete areas
- Assess for potential salvage or complete replacement

## Success Criteria

For each system analysis:
- **Complete functionality mapping** - every significant function/class/controller documented
- **Business logic clarity** - understand what each system actually does
- **Integration understanding** - how each system connects to others
- **Usable reference documentation** - can be used to ask specific questions about system components
- **Technical implementation details** - enough detail to understand and modify the system

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Ruby system analysis** - most critical and complex
2. **Create detailed functionality maps** following the development methodology
3. **Focus on one system at a time** - complete each before moving to next
4. **Build usable reference documentation** - organized for practical use

This approach will give you the detailed, system-specific documentation needed to understand and work with each individual system, rather than high-level overviews.
