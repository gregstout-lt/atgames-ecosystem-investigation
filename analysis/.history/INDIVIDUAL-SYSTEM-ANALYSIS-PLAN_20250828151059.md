# Individual System Analysis Plan
**Following Development Methodology for Large Existing Systems**

## Overview

This plan follows our development methodology for understanding large existing systems by creating detailed functionality maps, component breakdowns, and technical reference documentation for each system individually.

## Phase 1: System Mapping and Context Creation (MANDATORY)

### **For Each System, Create:**

#### 1.1 **Technical Reference Map**
- **Map all existing functions, constants, and components** - document what currently exists
- **Document relationships and dependencies** - how components interact within the system
- **Create functionality overview tables** - tabular summaries organized by functional area
- **Focus on understanding, not reorganizing** - map what exists before making changes

#### 1.2 **Annotate All Coding Sections**
- **Add AI ASSISTANT CONTEXT NOTES to each significant file**
- **Include system integration context and dependencies**
- **Document purpose, key functions, and requirements**

#### 1.3 **Component Decomposition Analysis**
- **Create detailed functionality maps** - tables showing functions, purpose, parameters, location
- **Group related functions** - organize by functional area
- **Document integration points** - how components interact within the system

## Phase 2: Individual System Analysis Structure

### **System 1: arcadenet (Ruby on Rails)**
**Target**: Complete business logic understanding

#### Analysis Structure:
```

#### Key Focus Areas:
- **Controllers**: Complete breakdown of all 100+ controllers
- **Models**: Business logic within ActiveRecord models
- **Services**: Service layer architecture and patterns
- **APIs**: Detailed endpoint functionality (not just routes)
- **Business Rules**: Payment processing, subscription logic, device management

### **System 2: retro_backend_java (Java Spring Boot)**
**Target**: Understanding incomplete modernization scope

#### Analysis Structure:

- **Database Layer**: JPA/Hibernate implementation
- **Service Architecture**: How business logic is structured
- **Integration Points**: How it connects to other systems

### **System 3: QT-OS (Qt Desktop Application)**
**Target**: Hardware interface and user experience system

#### Analysis Structure:

└── 07-business-logic-within-qt-system.md
```

#### Key Focus Areas:
- **UI Architecture**: Qt widget structure and user flows
- **Network Layer**: HTTP client implementation and API communication
- **Local Business Logic**: What business rules exist within the Qt app
- **Hardware Interface**: How it communicates with CE-OS
- **Configuration Management**: Settings and device configuration

### **System 4: CE-OS (C++ Magic Pixel Engine)**
**Target**: Core engine and hardware control (excluding existing interface docs)

#### Analysis Structure:
```

├── 01-technical-reference-map.md
├── 02-engine-architecture-breakdown.md
├── 03-hardware-abstraction-layer.md

├── 05-license-and-drm-implementation.md
├── 06-system-integration-apis.md
└── 07-configuration-and-asset-management.md
```

#### Key Focus Areas:
- **Engine Architecture**: Core Magic Pixel engine structure
- **Hardware Layer**: Rockchip-specific implementations
- **Game Management**: How games are executed and managed
- **DRM/Licensing**: Local license validation and management
- **System APIs**: Internal APIs for QT-OS communication

## Phase 3: Implementation Priority

### **Priority 1: arcadenet (Ruby System)** 
- **Rationale**: Primary production system with most business logic
- **Impact**: Understanding this system is critical for any future work
- **Complexity**: Highest - 1,100+ endpoints and complex business rules

### **Priority 2: QT-OS (Qt System)**
- **Rationale**: User-facing system with hardware integration
- **Impact**: Critical for understanding user experience and device communication
- **Complexity**: Medium - Well-structured Qt application with clear patterns

### **Priority 3: CE-OS (C++ Engine)**
- **Rationale**: Core system functionality (excluding documented interfaces)
- **Impact**: Important for understanding hardware capabilities
- **Complexity**: High - C++ engine with hardware-specific code

### **Priority 4: retro_backend_java (Java System)**
- **Rationale**: Incomplete system with limited scope
- **Impact**: Lower priority due to incomplete state
- **Complexity**: Medium - Standard Spring Boot patterns

## Phase 4: Documentation Standards

### **For Each System Analysis Document:**

#### Required Sections:
1. **System Overview** - Purpose and role within ecosystem
2. **Architecture Breakdown** - Internal structure and patterns
3. **Functionality Tables** - Detailed component mapping
4. **Business Logic Analysis** - What business rules exist within the system
5. **Integration Points** - How it connects to other systems (minimal)
6. **Technical Implementation** - Code patterns and architectural decisions
7. **Configuration and Data Management** - How the system manages its data

#### Documentation Format:
- **Functionality Maps**: Tables with Function Name, Purpose, Parameters, Location, Dependencies
- **Component Breakdowns**: Organized by functional area within the system
- **Code Examples**: Actual code snippets showing implementation patterns
- **Business Logic Flow**: How business rules are implemented within the system

## Success Criteria

### **For Each System Analysis:**
- [ ] **Complete functionality inventory** - every major component documented
- [ ] **Business logic understanding** - clear picture of what business rules exist within the system
- [ ] **Architecture comprehension** - understand how the system is structured internally
- [ ] **Implementation patterns** - understand the coding patterns and architectural decisions
- [ ] **Usable reference documentation** - can be used to understand and work with the system

### **Overall Success:**
- [ ] **Individual system expertise** - deep understanding of each system in isolation
- [ ] **Business logic mapping** - clear picture of where business logic lives
- [ ] **Technical reference** - usable documentation for development work
- [ ] **Foundation for questions** - ability to ask specific questions about system components
